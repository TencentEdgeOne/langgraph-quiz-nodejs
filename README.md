# LangGraph Quiz Agent

> An interactive quiz agent built with LangGraph on EdgeOne Makers — generates trivia questions, evaluates answers, gives hints, and tracks score across a multi-turn conversation.

**Framework:** LangGraph · **Category:** Quick Start · **Language:** TypeScript

## Overview

LangGraph Quiz Agent runs an interactive trivia game as a stateful graph. The LLM generates multiple-choice questions, the user picks an answer, and the graph evaluates correctness — giving a hint on the first wrong attempt before revealing the answer. Score and progress are tracked across the session.

- **Stateful quiz flow** — a LangGraph graph manages the full question lifecycle: generate → await → evaluate → hint/finalize → progress
- **Human-in-the-loop** — uses `interrupt()` to pause the graph while waiting for the user's answer
- **Adaptive hints** — on a wrong first attempt, the LLM provides a nudge without revealing the answer
- **Bilingual** — questions and UI support both Chinese and English
- **Visual graph** — the frontend renders the LangGraph state machine as a Mermaid flowchart with active node highlighting

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Yes | Model gateway API key. Use your **Makers Models API Key**, or any OpenAI-compatible provider key. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` | Yes | Gateway base URL. For Makers Models, use `https://ai-gateway.edgeone.link/v1`. |

> This template follows the **OpenAI-compatible** standard — you can point these variables at Makers Models or any other compatible gateway / provider.

### How to get `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`

1. Open the [Makers Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/edgeone/makers).
2. Sign in and enable Makers.
3. Go to **Makers → Models → API Key** and create a key.
4. Copy it into `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (set `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` to `https://ai-gateway.edgeone.link/v1`).

Built-in models (`@makers/deepseek-v4-flash`, `@makers/hy3-preview`, `@makers/minimax-m2.7`) are free and rate-limited — great for prototyping. For production, bind your own provider key (BYOK) in the console.

## Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
edgeone makers dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/agent-metrics` for the local observability panel.

## How It Works

The agent runs as a **session-mode** runtime: requests sharing the same `conversation_id` are routed to the same instance with persistent state.

### Workflow

1. **Start** (`action: "start"`) — initializes the graph with language and question count, then streams the first question.
2. **Generate Question** — LLM produces a multiple-choice question via structured output (tool call).
3. **Await Answer** — graph pauses via `interrupt()`; the frontend receives a `waiting` SSE event.
4. **Answer** (`action: "answer"`) — user submits A/B/C/D; graph resumes and evaluates correctness.
5. **Evaluate** — if correct, finalize; if wrong on first attempt, give a hint then await again; if wrong on second attempt, reveal the answer.
6. **Progress** — updates score, emits progress event, then either loops to the next question or ends.
7. **Complete** — after all questions, emits final score and statistics.

### Key Mechanisms

- **LangGraph StateGraph**: nodes and conditional edges define the quiz flow; `interrupt()` enables human-in-the-loop.
- **Structured output**: question generation uses `bindTools` with a schema to ensure consistent 4-option format.
- **Custom stream events**: uses `config.writer!` to emit typed events (`question`, `result`, `hint_done`, `feedback`, `progress`).
- **Checkpointer**: conversation state is persisted via `context.store.langgraphCheckpointer`; `resume` action restores mid-quiz sessions.

### Routes

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/quiz` | POST | Main quiz endpoint — actions: `start`, `answer`, `resume`, `graph` |
| `/stop` | POST | Abort an active quiz run |

The `conversation_id` is passed via the `makers-conversation-id` request header.
